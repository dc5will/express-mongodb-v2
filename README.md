## Motivation

Building a RESTful API with Node, Express & MongoDB

## Built With
- JavaScript ES6
- ReactJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB

## Getting Started
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies locally
- Run `npm run devStart` to start nodemon server
- Use `routes.rest` file to test calls to the database or use Postman

## Notes/Takeaways
- 'use strict' was causing a bug on subscribers.js affecting getSubscriber async/await function
- extra line is needed between header and body for requests in route.rest
